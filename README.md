# Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction
This repository hosts the python codes for Heart Attack Predication.

## Tools/Packages/Libraries
1. Python (Libraries: NumPy, Scikit)
2. Jupyter Notebook

##  Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

##  Objective
Develop a machine learning (ML) model which successfully predicts the vulnerability of a person to a heart attack with an accuracy of > 90%..

## Learning Outcomes 
1. Implemented classification algorithms by using various sklearn libraries such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Naïve Bayes’ Gaussian NB, etc.
2. Implemented machine learning models to test for A/B content that was useful for making better decisions regarding the dataset.
